# Augmented-WW-Sensor
Code for the Augmented Woodwind Sensor Project

This Repo contains all of the code included on the Augmented WW Sensor unit as well as a collection of Max Examples and help patches that can be used to help you set up your own project or performance. 

If desired you can download the code here and make your own edits. The unit can be restored to its original state by reinstalling the code through the Arduino IDE. You can also update your unit to the most recent version through the same process.

The Arduino IDE can be installed through arduino.cc/en/Main/Software 

Max can be installed through Cycling74.com/downloads. Purchasing a Max licence is not required to run anything from this repo, but is recommended as you will need to purchase a licence in order to save any changes or presets to the included patches.

This project is set up by Matthew A. Bardin; A PHD Student at LSU. For more information, visit matthewbardin.com.
