# Augmented-WW-Sensor-main

This is the repository for my Augmented Woodwind Sensor dissertation project. I will update this periodically as I continue working on it. Expect more changes and formatting as time goes on.

I will likely change this repo to a final one once the ptoject is in its final stages. It currently includes:

the code running on the board
schematics
a library of useful Max/MSP tools for using the sensor
Instructions
