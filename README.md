# Augmented-WW-Sensor-main


MAJOR UPDATES: I will be creating a new Version 1.0 repository with updated code, PCB diagrams, Scematics, and Maxpatches. Stay tuned for more exciting info as Version 1.1 nears completion!






This is the repository for my Cyberinet dissertation project. I will update this periodically as I continue working on it. Expect more changes and formatting as time goes on.

I will likely change this repo to a final one once the project is in its final stages. It currently includes:

the code running on the board
schematics
a library of useful Max/MSP tools for using the sensor
Instructions
